MSE is a music mapping tool for GDevelop designed to track and key beats in audio/music. Itâ€™s particularly useful for creating rhythm games like Friday Night Funkin' (FNF), Geometry Dash, Guitar Hero, and other similar games.

MSE saves the keys you map in JSON files. These files can be converted into an array/structure variable in GDevelop using the "JSON to Variable" extension.
